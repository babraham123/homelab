route:
  # The labels by which incoming alerts are grouped together. For example,
  # multiple alerts coming in for cluster=A and alertname=LatencyHigh would
  # be batched into a single group.
  #
  # To aggregate by all possible labels use '...' as the sole label name.
  # This effectively disables aggregation entirely, passing through all
  # alerts as-is. This is unlikely to be what you want, unless you have
  # a very low alert volume or your upstream notification system performs
  # its own grouping. Example: group_by: [...]
  group_by: ['alertname', 'instance']

  # When a new group of alerts is created by an incoming alert, wait at
  # least 'group_wait' to send the initial notification.
  # This way ensures that you get multiple alerts for the same group that start
  # firing shortly after another are batched together on the first
  # notification.
  group_wait: 30s

  # When the first notification was sent, wait 'group_interval' to send a batch
  # of new alerts that started firing for that group.
  group_interval: 5m

  # If an alert has successfully been sent, wait 'repeat_interval' to
  # resend them.
